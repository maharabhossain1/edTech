      'This Meccan surah, which is recited a total of seventeen times in the five daily prayers, serves as the cornerstone of the Quran. It sums up the relationship between the Creator and His creation, Allah’s undisputed authority in this world and the Hereafter, and humanity’s constant dependence on Him for guidance and assistance. The underlying theme is to acknowledge that He is the only god worthy of worship—a simple truth which the disbelievers fail to grasp. All fundamental principles encapsulated in this surah are spelled out in the rest of the Quran',

      '<b>Surah al-Fatiḥah is a cure and treatment for illnesses</b>\r\nAbu Sa’id al-Khudri said, “Some of the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ went on a journey. They alighted with a certain clan of the Arabs. Someone of them said, “Our chief has been stung by a scorpion or bitten by a snake. Has any of you something which gives relief to our chief?” A man of the people said, “Yes, I swear by Allah. I can recite an incantation, but we asked you for hospitality and you denied it to us. I shall not recite the incantation until you give me some payment.” So, they promised to give some sheep to him. He came to him and recited Surah al-Fatiḥah over him and blew (upon him) till he was cured, and he seemed as if he were set free from a bond. So, they gave him the payment that was agreed between them. They said, “Distribute it.” The man who applied the treatment said, “Do not do it until we approach the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.” And He ﷺ said, “From where did you learn that it was a treatment? You have done right. Apportion them, and give me a share along with you.” [Sahih al-Bukhari 5007]\r\n\r\n<b>The Greatest Surah</b>\r\nAbu Sa’id bin al-Mu’alla (RA) reported, “I was praying when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ  passed by me and called me. I didn’t come to him until I finished praying. Then I came to him and he said, “What prevented you from coming? Didn’t Allah say, ‘O you who believe, respond to Allah and to the Messenger when he calls you’?” Then he said, “I shall teach you the greatest surah in the Qur’an before I leave.” The Messenger of Allah ﷺ started to leave so I reminded him of it.” Mu’ath said, “Shu’bah narrated this to us from Khubayb, who heard from Hafs, who heard from Abu Sa’id, a man from the companions of the Prophet ﷺ, and he said, “It is ‘Alhamdu lillahi Rabbil ‘alameen (i.e., Surah Al-Fatiḥah) which is As-Sab’ Al-Mathani (i.e., the seven oft-repeated ayat).” [Sahih al-Bukhari 4474]\r\n\r\nAnas bin Malik reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was heading somewhere and a man came to his side, so the Prophet ﷺ turned to him and said, “Shall I not inform you about the greatest (part) of the Quran? The man said, “Yes.” So he (the Prophet ﷺ) recited, Alhamdu lillahi Rabbil ‘alameen (i.e., Surah Al-Fatiḥah). [Sunan an-Nasaʾi al-Kubra 8011, Ṣaḥiḥ Ibn Ḥibban  774, and Mustadrak al-Ḥakim 2056 with slight variations]\r\n\r\n"It was narrated that Ubayy bin Ka’b said, “The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, Allah did not reveal in the Tawrah or the Injil anything like Umm al-Quran (al-Fatiḥah), which is the seven oft-recited (verses), and (Allah said) it is divided between Myself and My slave will have what he asked for.” [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3125]\r\n\r\nFatiḥatul-Kitab (Surah al-Fatiḥah), and the concluding (ayat) of Surah Al-Baqarah.

      '<b>The last two verses of Surat al-Baqarah guarantee sufficiency</b>\r\nAbdullah b. Masʿud (RA) reported that the Prophet ﷺ said: “Whoever reads the last two verses from Surat al-Baqarah at night, they will be sufficient for him.” [Sahih al-Bukhari 5009]\r\n\r\nRegarding the word ‘sufficient’ in the hadith, Imam al-Nawawi (RA) says: It was said (by scholars) that it means it will suffice him from the night prayer, and others said it means as a protection against the devils, and yet others said it means protection against harmful animals, and it is likely encompassing of all these things (and more).”\r\n\r\nIbn Ḥajar states: “[It] was explicitly reported by ʿasim from ʿAlqamah from Ibn Masʿud, “Whoever recites (the two verses at) the end of Surat al-Baqarah, it will be sufficient for him instead of standing in prayer for one night.”\r\n\r\n<b>Protection and blessings in this life and the next</b>\r\nAbu Umamah said he heard Allah’s Messenger ﷺ say, “Recite the Qur’an, for on the Day of Resurrection it will come as an intercessor for those who recite it. Recite the two bright ones, al-Baqarah and Surah ale-Imran, for on the Day of Resurrection they will come as two clouds or two shades, or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them. Recite Surah al-Baqarah, for to take recourse to it is a blessing and to give it up is a cause of grief, and the magicians cannot confront it.” [Sahih Muslim 804a]\r\n\r\nAl-Nawwas Ibn Sam’an reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said “The Qur’an will be brought on the Day of Resurrection, along with its companions who used to act by it, at the front being Surah al-Baqarah and Al ‘Imran. He (the Messenger ﷺ) likened them (the two suwar) to three things which I did not forget. He said they will be like two clouds, or two black canopies with light between them, or like two flocks of birds in ranks pleading for one who recited them. [Sahih Muslim 805]\r\n\r\nAbu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet ﷺ said, “Do not turn your households into graveyards. Indeed, the devils flee from a household that has Surah al-Baqarah recited in it.” [Sahih Muslim 780]\r\n\r\n<b>Protection from the devils</b>\r\nAllah’s Messenger ﷺ ordered me to guard the Zakat revenue of Ramaḍan. Then somebody came to me and started stealing from the provisions. I caught him and said, "I will take you to Allah’s Messenger!" \r\nThen Abu Hurayrah described the whole incident and said: That person said (to me), "Please don’t take me to Allah’s Messenger and I will tell you a few words by which Allah will benefit you. When you go to your bed, recite ayat al-Kursi, for then there will be (with you) a guardian from Allah who will protect you all night long, and Satan will not be able to come near you till dawn." When the Prophet ﷺ heard about the incident he said (to me), "He (who came to you at night) told you the truth although he is a liar; it was a devil." [Sahih al-Bukhari 5010]\r\n\r\nAllah\'s Messenger (ﷺ) said: O Abu\' al-Mundhir, do you know the verse from the Book of Allah which, according to you, is the greatest? I said: Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ) know best. He again said: Abu\'l-Mundhir, do you know the verse from the Book of Allah which, according to you, is the greatest? I said: Allah, there is no god but He, the Living, the Eternal. Thereupon he touched me on my chest and said: May knowledge be pleasant for you, O Abu\'l-Mundhir!” [Sahih Muslim 810]\r\n\r\n<b>A guarantee of paradise</b>\r\nThe Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “Whoever reads ayatul Kursi at the end of (after) each mandatory prayer, nothing prevents him from entering paradise except death.” [Sunan an-Nasaʾi al-Kubra, no. 9848, and al-Ṭabarani, no. 7532]\r\n\r\n<b>A Gift During the Night Journey</b>\r\nIt is narrated on the authority of Abdullaah (b. Umar) that when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was taken for the Night (mi’raj) journey, he was taken to Sidrat al-Muntaha, which is situated on the sixth heaven, where terminates everything that ascends from the earth and is held there, and where terminates everything that descends from above it and is held there. (It is with reference to this that) Allah said (in the meaning of), “while the Lote Tree was overwhelmed with ˹heavenly˺ splendours” (53:16). The narrator said: (It was) gold moths. He also said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was given three things: “He was given the five daily prayers, he was given the concluding verses of Surah al-Baqarah (i.e., 285-286), and forgiveness of serious sins for those among his Ummah who do not associate partners with Allah.” [Sahih Muslim 173]\r\n\r\n<b>2000 years before the creation of the heavens and the earth</b>\r\nAn-Nu’man bin Basheer reported that the Prophet ﷺ said: “Allah inscribed a book two thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, from which the last two verses of Surat al-Baqarah were revealed. If they are recited for three nights in a home, no devil will come near it.” [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2882]\r\n\r\nIt was narrated that ʿAli  said, “I did not think that any reasonable person could sleep without reciting the last verses of Surat al-Baqarah, and they are indeed treasures from beneath the Throne.” [Sunan al-Darimi 3289]\r\n\r\n<b>The Greatest Name of Allah</b>\r\nAbu Umamah reported that the Prophet ﷺ said, “Allah’s Most Magnificent name, which when used to implore Him, He responds, is found in three suwar: Al-Baqarah, al-Imran, and Taha (meaning Al-Hayy al-Qayyoom).” [Sunan ibn Majah 3856 . Al-Tabarani 7925, Al-Silsilah al-Ṣaḥiḥah 746]\r\n\r\n<b>The sanam (peak) of the Qur’an</b>\r\nAbdullah b. Masʿud said, “Everything has a peak (i.e., pinnacle) and the peak of the Qur’an is al-Baqarah.” [Sunan ad-Darimi 2179. Al-Silsilah al-Ṣaḥiḥah, 135/2]\r\n\r\n<b>The verse to be recited after ṭawaf (circuits around the kaʿbah)</b>\r\nIt was narrated from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah performed Tawaf, walking rapidly (raml) for three circuits, and walking at a normal pace for four. Then he recited: "And take you the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer." And prayed two rakʿahs with the Maqam between him and the kaʿbah. Then he touched the Corner, then he went out and said: \'As-Safa and Al-Marwah are two of the symbols of Allah. We will start with that with which Allah started. [Sunan an-Nasa\'i 2962]\r\n\r\nJabir reported: “The Messenger of Allah ﷺ went out to aṣ-Ṣafa and said. We will start with that with which Allah started. Then he recited the verse: \'Verily, (the hills of) aṣ-Ṣafa and Al-Marwah are of the symbols of Allah… (Al-Baqarah, 2:158)" [Sunan an-Nasa\'i 2970]\r\n\r\n<b>Tranquility descends upon its recitation</b>\r\nUsayd bin Hudayr reported: While he was reciting Surat Al-Baqarah at night, and his horse was tied beside him, the horse was suddenly startled and troubled. When he stopped reciting, the horse became quiet, and when he started reciting again, the horse was startled again. Then he stopped reciting and the horse became quiet too. He started reciting again and the horse was startled and troubled once again. Then he stopped reciting and his son, Yahya was beside the horse (in potential danger from the horse). He was afraid that the horse might trample on him. When he took the boy away and looked towards the sky, he could not see it. The next morning, he informed the Prophet who said, "Recite, O Ibn Hudayr! Recite, O Ibn Hudayr!" Ibn Hudayr replied, "O Allah\'s Messenger (ﷺ)! My son, Yahya was near the horse and I was afraid that it might trample on him, so I looked towards the sky, and went to him. When I looked at the sky, I saw something like a cloud containing what looked like lamps, so I went out in order not to see it." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Do you know what that was?" Ibn Hudayr replied, "No." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Those were Angels who came near to you for your voice and if you had kept on reciting till dawn, it would have remained there till morning when people would have seen it as it would not have disappeared.

Those of you who live up to his time should recite over him the opening verses of Surah al-Kahf, for they are your protection from his trial.” We asked, “How long will he remain on the earth?” He replied, “Forty days, one like a year, one like a month, one like a week, and rest of his days like yours.” We asked, “Messenger of Allah ﷺ, will one day’s prayer suffice us in this day which will be like a year?” He replied, “No, you must make an estimate of its extent. Then Jesus son of Mary will descend at the white minaret to the east of Damascus. He will then catch him up at the gate of Ludd and kill him.” [Sunan ad-Darimi 4321; A more detailed narration is found in Sahih Muslim 2937]\n\n<b>A light between two Fridays</b>\nIt was reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, “Whoever reads Sūrat al-Kahf on the day of Jumu’ah, a light will shine for him between the two Fridays.” [Mustadrak al-Hakim; Sahih at-Targhib wa at-Tarhib 736]\n\nIt was reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, “Whoever reads Surat al-Kahf on the night of Jumu’ah, a light will shine for him which extends from him to the Ancient House (i.e., the Kaʿbah).” [Sunan al-Darimi 3312; Sunan Al-Bayhaqi 5856; Sahih al-Targhib wa at-Tarhib 736. Note: Jumu’ah is not equivalent to Friday, rather it begins at Maghrib/sunset of Thursday and ends as the maghrib/sunset time comes in on Friday]\n\nAbu Sa’īd al-Khudrī reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “Whoever recites Sūrat al-Kahf as it was revealed will have a light on the Day of Resurrection, from his position to Makkah, and whoever recites the final ten verses of it (Al-Kahf) and then encounters Al-Dajjal, will not be harmed (by him). And whoever makes wudu’ and then says: “SubhānakAllahumma wa behamdika lā ilāha illā anta, astaghfiruka wa atoobu elayk” (Glory and praise be to You, O Allah, there is no deity worthy of worship except for You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You),1 it will be written a scroll (of deeds), and then placed in a seal which will not be broken until the Day of Resurrection.” [As-Silsilah as-Sahihah 2651]\n\n<b>Tranquility descends</b>\nAl-Bara\' reported: A man was reciting Surat Al-Kahf and his horse was tied with two ropes beside him. A cloud came down and spread over that man, and it kept on coming closer and closer to him till his horse started jumping (as if afraid of something). When it was morning, the man came to the Prophet, and told him of that experience. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "That was tranquility which descended because of (the recitation of) the Qur\'an."

He (ﷺ) sent ’Uthmân ibn ’Affân to let the Meccans know that the Muslims had come in peace, only to visit the Sacred House. When the Meccans delayed ’Uthmân, the Prophet (ﷺ) thought they might have killed his envoy. So he (ﷺ) called upon the faithful to pledge allegiance to him under a tree at Ḥudaibiyah in the outskirts of Mecca. Shortly after, ’Uthmân returned safely and a peace agreement was signed by the Muslims and Meccan pagans, stating in part that the Muslims would have to return to Medina and come back next year for ’umrah. The Treaty of Ḥudaibiyah is described as a clear triumph since it established peace, temporarily diffused the tension between the Muslims and the Meccan pagans, and gave the Muslims plenty of time to spread awareness and understanding of their faith. Thousands from different tribes accepted Islam during that truce. The surah commends the believers for proving true to Allah and His Messenger, criticizes the hypocrites for not marching forth with the Prophet (ﷺ), and condemns the pagans for denying the believers access to the Sacred House.

This statement had been considered to be a form of divorce (known as ẓihâr) in Arabia. Khawlah came to the Prophet (ﷺ) to ask for his opinion. He (ﷺ) told her that he had not received any revelation in this regard, and that, based on tradition, she was divorced. She argued that she and her husband had children together who would suffer if their parents were separated. Then she started to plead to Allah as the Prophet (ﷺ) repeated the same answer. Eventually, this Medinian surah was revealed in response to her pleas, thereby abolishing this ancient practice. The surah emphasizes Allah’s infinite knowledge and overwhelming power, and makes it clear that those who ally themselves with Allah and comply with His orders are bound to prevail, whereas those who challenge Him and ally themselves with His enemies will be debased and vanquished.
